### Introduction

This repository is for our CVPR 2021 paper '[FedDG: Federated Domain Generalization on Medical Image Segmentation via Episodic Learning in Continuous Frequency Space](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.06030.pdf)'.

### Usage

1. Start with a demo for continuous frequency space interpolation among federated clicnets:
   ```shell
   python freq_space_interpolation_demo.py
   ```

</p>

2. Prepare the dataset, and then extract the amplitude spectrum of samples in each local client with the function in ``dataset/prepare_dataset.py``:

3. Organize the data (save the data as npy to speed up federated training) and amplitude spectrum of local clients as following structure:
   ``` 
     ├── dataset
        ├── client1
           ├── data_npy
               ├── sample1.npy, sample2.npy, xxxx
           ├── freq_amp_npy
               ├── amp_sample1.npy, amp_sample2.npy, xxxx
        ├── clientxxx
        ├── clientxxx
   ```
4. Train the federated learning model with ELCFS:
   ```shell
   python train_ELCFS.py
   ```
